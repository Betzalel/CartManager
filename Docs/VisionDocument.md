## 1 Introduction

SmoothieCart is designed for enhanced customer satisfaction through incentives while providing the establishment valuable information to increase customer purchases; leading to larger profits. All this in a simple Android application built for the on-the-go establishment that is ready to take their business to the next level.

## 2 Business Needs/Requirements

To continue growing a viable and engaged customer base, incentives are paramount. Keeping track of those incentives can be difficult and time consuming as difficult formulas can complicate book keeping. A program designed to enhance the users engagement level with the customer by easily tracking multiple incentive programs has many business applications that will help motivate a customer base and bring in more profits.

As the customer base expands, the personal relationship between the customer and the establishment can diminish. Using a customer's name has the potential to increase customer loyalty, generating more visits and sales. Identifying a customer via name or striking up a conversation about their "side of town" can be much easier with a program using an identification system such as a QR Code. Providing customer information to the establishment will help ensure customer loyalty and enhance visit satisfaction.

Not all businesses will want large computational devices; especially not an on-the-go establishment. Portable devices such as smart phones and tablets can be excellent resources if used properly. The limited view space and lack of peripheral can make portable devices viable. With an intuitive and simplistic user interface, a program can overcome these limitations and meet the full needs of the on-the-go establishment. The value added from the portable devices will enhance the customer experience while increasing throughput for the establishment.

## 3 Product / Solution Overview

SmoothieCart is designed to meet the business requirements listed above. It brings together a mobile platform that will enhance your customer's experience through personal interaction and incentives. By combining incentives, enhanced personal relationships for growing customer bases, and an on-the-go platform, SmoothieCart delivers an exceptional user experience while increasing productivity and meeting establishment needs.

SmoothieCart provides multiple incentives to an establishment's customers. These incentives are native to the platform and require no management on the establishments part. By being integrated, the establishment can focus on their customers and building customer loyalty.

To assist with customer loyalty and enlarging the customer base, SmoothieCart provides the establishment information on the customer to increase the affinity between customer and establishment. A positive customer experience will lead to referrals and a larger customer base. It will also incentive the customer to return.

Designed for the non-traditional establishment, SmoothieCart is an excellent resource for mobile business. The establishment can take the benefits of SmoothieCart to their customers for a greater effect due to its development on portable devices.

## 5 Scope and Limitations

SmoothieCart is designed for growing small businesses that wish to increase their customer base and profits. While targeting portable devices allows SmoothieCart to breach a traditional establishments boundaries, it does limit the capabilities of a traditional platform.

The number of peripheral devices is limited to only a credit card reader. SmoothieCart uses the built in camera on the portable device as the QR Code reader. This combination provides the establishment with a lot of power while not requiring a large amount of extra equipment.

Portable devices are also limited on available storage. While SmoothieCart is designed to keep track of an establishment's customers, there will be a limit. This is one reason SmoothieCart is targeted to small businesses.

Incentives are native to the SmoothieCart which prevents the establishment from worrying about implementation. This also requires any changes to or additional incentives to be developed by Team 11 LLC. Our job it to ensure the best experience with little to no requirements from the establishment from our deployed products.
