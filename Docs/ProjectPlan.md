# Project Plan for Project #2 -- Team 11

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to develop SmoothieCart, an android-based payment and rewards management system for smoothie cart vendors.  

## 2 Process Description

This project will be using a simplified version of the Unified Software Process. The phases are:  

(1) Inception - Deliverable 1 due 10/16/15  
(2) Elaboration - Deliverable 1 due 10/16/15  
(3) Construction  - Deliverable 2 due 10/30/15  
(4) Transition - Deliverable 3 due 11/13/15

### 2.1 Inception Phase

In the Inception phase the team will begin focusing on requirements engineering activities. The team will use the customer's submitted requirements to develop the following documentation: initial **project plan**, **vision document**, **use case models** and a supplementary requirements document if needed. Additional refinement of requirements will determine project scope, prioritization of business cases and identification of any project risks.

#### 2.1.1 Inception Phase Entrance Criteria

The entrance criteria for the Design Phase are as follows:
- The team has received requirements and begins the requirements engineering process

#### 2.1.2 Inception Phase Exit Criteria

The exit criteria for the Design Phase are as follows:
- The team has an acceptable understanding of requirements needed to complete the project with stakeholder concurrence.
- The team has created a **Vision Document** describing the overall vision of the project.
- The team has identified relevant use cases and documented them in a **Use Case Models** document.
- The team has created a **Project Plan** that details the project goals, deliverables and how they will be achieved.
- The team has created an optional Supplementary requirements document for non-functional requirements if needed.

### 2.2 Elaboration Phase
In the Elaboration phase the team will conduct analysis and begin creating the project design specifications.  The team will begin making design decisions based upon the documentation created during the Inception phase to produce a **Design Document**.  The team will create a **Test Plan** document of the test cases that will be used during the Construction phase to ensure the product operates as intended. 

#### 2.2.1 Elaboration Phase Entrance Criteria
The entrance criteria for the Elaboration Phase are as follows:
- The team has an acceptable understanding of requirements needed to begin design work on the project.    
- The team has identified relevant use cases and documented them in a **Use Case Models** document.  
- The team has created a **Project Plan** that details the project goals and how they will be achieved.  

#### 2.2.2 Elaboration Phase Exit Criteria
The exit criteria for the Elaboration Phase are as follows:
- The team has created a **Design Document**.  
- The team has created a **Test Plan** document.  
- The team has made any necessary revisions to documents created during the Inception phase.    

### 2.3 Construction Phase
In the Construction phase the team will begin implementing the product design based upon the **Design Document**.  Testing will also begin using test cases created during the Inception phase to confirm that all user requirements were implemented.

#### 2.3.1 Construction Phase Entrance Criteria
The entrance criteria for the Construction Phase are as follows:
- The team has a **Test Plan** document.
- The team has a **Design Document**.

#### 2.3.2 Construction Phase Exit Criteria
The exit criteria for the Construction Phase are as follows:
- The team has begun testing based upon test cases identified in the **Test Plan**.
- The team has completed initial **UserManual** in a markdown format.
- The team has completed **Traceability Documentation**.
- The team has completed an alpha version of the app.
- The team has made any necessary revisions to documents created during the Inception and Elaboration phases.  

### 2.4 Transition Phase
In the Transition phase the team will complete final steps in order to release the product to the customer.  

#### 2.4.1 Transition Phase Entrance Criteria
The entrance criteria for the Transition Phase are as follows:
- The team has completed an alpha version of the app.  
- The team has implemented the specifications of the **Design Document**.  

#### 2.4.2 Transition Phase Exit Criteria
The exit criteria for the Transition Phase are as follows:
- The team has completed a final version of the app
- The team has confirmed that the developed program is usable and meets the customer's needs.
- The team has validated that the requested program has passed each test case identified in the **Test Plan**.
- The team has finalized documentation; making all necessary revisions (including current screenshots) to documents created during the Inception, Elaboration and Construction phases.  

## 3 Team
